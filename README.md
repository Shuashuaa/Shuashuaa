<!-- who enjoys solving problems, creating retina display-ready user interfaces, exploring the latest trends and technologies, and focusing on web app development. -->
<!-- I have been fascinated by web design since my college days. I discovered that while web designs can be visually stunning, they also require programming to function effectively. This realization ignited my passion for web development, particularly in front-end development. Over the past three years, I have gained experience in web app development and continue to enhance my skills in both front-end and overall software development.

<!-- I am a software developer with three years of experience in full-stack development, specializing in scalable projects. My expertise lies in developing web applications using JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and Git. Additionally, I have gained proficiency in Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, testing, and debugging.
